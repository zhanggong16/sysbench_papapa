summary: Scriptable database and system performance benchmark
description: |
 sysbench is a scriptable multi-threaded benchmark tool based on
 LuaJIT. It is most frequently used for database benchmarks, but can also
 be used to create arbitrarily complex workloads that do not involve a
 database server.
 
 sysbench comes with the following bundled benchmarks:

 - oltp_*.lua: a collection of OLTP-like database benchmarks
 - fileio: a filesystem-level benchmark
 - cpu: a simple CPU benchmark
 - memory: a memory access benchmark
 - threads: a thread-based scheduler benchmark
 - mutex: a POSIX mutex benchmark
